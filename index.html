  <h1>Laser Frenectomy – Gentle, Precise Care for Children</h1>
  <p>At Lakewood Kids Dentistry Houston, we provide advanced <a href="https://www.lakewoodkidsdentistry.com/services/frenectomy/">Laser Frenectomy in Houston</a> treatment designed specifically for infants and children. Located at 13331 Jones Rd, Houston, TX 77070, our office combines state-of-the-art laser technology with a warm, welcoming environment. Parents searching for a trusted Pediatric Dental Office Houston can rely on our compassionate team to correct tongue-tie or lip-tie safely and effectively. With a quick procedure and minimal discomfort, our care ensures children can eat, speak, and grow with confidence.</p>

  <h2>What Is a Laser Frenectomy?</h2>
  <p>A Laser Frenectomy is a modern dental procedure that releases the small band of tissue, known as the frenulum, located under the tongue or upper lip. When this tissue is too tight, it can restrict movement and lead to difficulties with breastfeeding, eating, or speaking. Unlike traditional surgical methods, laser treatment is minimally invasive, virtually pain-free, and requires no stitches. Our experienced <a href="https://www.lakewoodkidsdentistry.com/">Pediatric Dentist in Houston</a> uses a precise dental laser to remove the restriction in just minutes, ensuring exceptional comfort and faster healing Here are two types of Laser Frenectomy.</p>
<p><strong> Labial Frenectomy</strong> :
A Labial Frenectomy gently releases the tight tissue connecting the upper lip to the gums. This quick laser procedure closes gaps between teeth and protects gum health with minimal discomfort.</p>
<p><strong>Lingual Frenectomy</strong>:
A Lingual Frenectomy frees the tissue under the tongue that causes tongue-tie. Using advanced laser technology, it improves feeding, speech, and oral movement almost immediately.<p>
  <h2>Signs Your Child May Need a Laser Frenectomy</h2>
  <p>Recognizing early symptoms of tongue-tie or lip-tie can make a significant difference in your child’s oral development. Babies may struggle with latching during breastfeeding or show poor weight gain. Older children might have speech delays, difficulty pronouncing certain sounds, or gaps between their upper front teeth. If you notice these signs, scheduling an evaluation at our Pediatric Dental Office Houston is the best next step. Early treatment prevents long-term dental and speech issues while improving your child’s daily comfort.
</p>

  <h2>Benefits of Laser Frenectomy</h2>
  <p>A Laser Frenectomy offers several advantages for both children and parents. The treatment is quick—usually completed in a single visit—and causes minimal bleeding or swelling. Because the laser sterilizes the tissue while working, the risk of infection is extremely low. Most importantly, recovery is rapid, allowing children to resume normal activities the same day.</p>
  <p>Key Benefits: Fast Healing – most patients heal within a few days; Minimal Discomfort – laser precision reduces pain and swelling; Exceptional Accuracy – the laser targets only the restricted tissue, protecting surrounding areas for a gentle, precise result. Families across Houston appreciate these advantages and trust our skilled Pediatric Dentist in Houston to deliver safe, effective care.</p>

  <h2>Our Laser Frenectomy Process</h2>
  <p>Understanding the procedure can help parents feel at ease. During the first visit, we review your child’s medical history and perform a comprehensive oral examination. Our team explains the entire process, answers questions, and creates a customized treatment plan.</p>
  <p>On the day of the procedure, the Laser Frenectomy typically takes only a few minutes. The dental laser gently releases the restrictive tissue while sealing blood vessels at the same time. This means no stitches and very little bleeding. Afterward, we provide detailed aftercare instructions and schedule a follow-up appointment to monitor healing. Throughout every step, our friendly staff ensures your child’s comfort and safety in our welcoming Pediatric Dental Office Houston.</p>

  <h2>Aftercare and Recovery</h2>
  <p>One of the greatest benefits of a Laser Frenectomy is the short recovery period. Most children experience only mild tenderness and can eat or speak normally within hours. We recommend simple stretching exercises and careful oral hygiene to support healing and maintain mobility. Our team is always available to answer questions and provide guidance, giving parents peace of mind during the recovery process.</p>
